![summary](resources/d1.PNG)

- The factors that have the most impact on MPG are Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero becauces the p-value of 5.35e-11 is much lower than our assumed significance level of 0.05 percent.
- This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the R-Squared value is 0.7149.
